Release 0.2.4 (10 April, 2011)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notable changes:

 * Give an error if the index file is older than the data file.

 * Avoid a segfault given flawed input.

 * Added Python APIs contributed by Hyeshik Chang. The new APIs do not bind to
   the dynamic library and are reported to be faster. Pysam also comes with a
   tabix binding.

 * Added option "-r" for efficient header replacement.

 * Added BED support.

 * Synchronized the BGZF library between tabix and samtools.

(0.2.4: 10 April 2011, r949)



Beta Release 0.2.3 (8 December, 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notable changes:

 * Fixed a minor bug where the first record in a headerless file may be
   missed.

 * Added an option to print header lines.

 * Fixed a rare bug which may occasionally happen when retrieving data
   from a region without any records.

 * Enhanced error reporting.

 * Fixed a bug in bgzip which may delete the original file even if not
   intended.

(0.2.3: 8 December 2010, r876)



Beta Release 0.2.2 (28 June, 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notable changes:

 * Dropped the VCF3 support. Added VCF4 support.

Beta Release 0.2.1 (3 June, 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notable changes:

   shared library.

(0.2.1: 3 June 2010, r582)



Beta Release 0.2.0 (11 May, 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notable changes:

 * Fixed an issue for random access given an interval end larger than
   2^29.

 * Updated the Java binding.

 * Added a Perl module using XS.

 * Improved the C APIs.

(0.2.0: 11 May 2010, r574)



Beta Release 0.1.6 (9 May, 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notable changes:

 * Improved backward compatibility. Release 0.1.5 does not work with the
   buggy index file generated by 0.1.2.

 * Fixed a bug in building linear index. The bug does not affect the
   results, only affects efficiency in rare cases.

 * Reduced the number of seek calls given an index generated by old
   version of tabix.

 * Added new APIs for retrieving data via an iterator. The old callback
   APIs are not changed, although internally it uses iterator to
   retrieve data.

I am trying to freeze tabix. I just hope I am committing new bugs.

(0.1.6: 9 May 2010, r563)



Beta Release 0.1.5 (5 May, 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notable changes:

 * Clarified that tabix is released under MIT/X11.

 * Improved the robustness of indexing and retrieval.

 * Reduced the number of seek calls when the specified region starts
   from a 16kb block with no data. The index format is the same, but the
   content is changed a little.
