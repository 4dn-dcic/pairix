Beta Release 0.2.0 (11 May, 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notable changes:

 * Fixed an issue for random access given an interval end larger than
   2^29.

 * Updated the Java binding.

 * Added a Perl module using XS.

 * Improved the C APIs.

(0.2.0: 11 May 2010, r574)



Beta Release 0.1.6 (9 May, 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notable changes:

 * Improved backward compatibility. Release 0.1.5 does not work with the
   buggy index file generated by 0.1.2.

 * Fixed a bug in building linear index. The bug does not affect the
   results, only affects efficiency in rare cases.

 * Reduced the number of seek calls given an index generated by old
   version of tabix.

 * Added new APIs for retrieving data via an iterator. The old callback
   APIs are not changed, although internally it uses iterator to
   retrieve data.

I am trying to freeze tabix. I just hope I am committing new bugs.

(0.1.6: 9 May 2010, r563)



Beta Release 0.1.5 (5 May, 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notable changes:

 * Clarified that tabix is released under MIT/X11.

 * Improved the robustness of indexing and retrieval.

 * Reduced the number of seek calls when the specified region starts
   from a 16kb block with no data. The index format is the same, but the
   content is changed a little.
